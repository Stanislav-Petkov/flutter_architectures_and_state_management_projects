# MVC Architecture in Flutter

## Components

1. **Model – Business Logic & State**
   - CounterModel
   - Responsible for data management and business logic
   - Independent of UI

2. **Controller – Bridges View and Model**
   - CounterController
   - Handles user input
   - Updates the model and triggers view updates

3. **View – UI**
   - CounterView
   - Displays information to the user
   - Forwards user actions to the controller

## Advantages of MVC in Flutter

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear division between data, presentation, and logic
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and modify individual components
- **Testability**: Models and controllers can be unit tested independently
- **Reusability**: Views and models can be reused across the application
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale as the application grows
- **Team Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different components
- **Stateless Views**: Views can remain stateless, making them more predictable
- **Reduced Complexity**: Each component has a single responsibility

## Disadvantages of MVC in Flutter

- **Boilerplate Code**: Requires more initial code compared to simpler patterns
- **Tight Coupling**: Controllers can become tightly coupled with views
- **Complexity for Simple Apps**: May be overkill for very simple applications
- **Learning Curve**: Steeper learning curve for beginners
- **Navigation Management**: Can be challenging to manage navigation between views
- **State Management Overlap**: May conflict with Flutter's built-in state management
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional layers can introduce slight performance overhead
- **Potential for Massive Controllers**: Controllers can grow too large as app complexity increases
